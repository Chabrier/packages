# gvle.decision modeling plugin **User Guide**

## overhall consideration

The gvle.decision has two main roles:
+ editing a plan file
+ providing a metadata file containing :
  - all the information of the plan model
  - the configuration of the vle atomic model that can run the plan

## The plan

Outputs are specified when configuring an activity.
They have a single reference name that can be shared by activities.

3 kinds of outputs can be associated to an activity:
- Output by Value
- Output by Parameter
- Output by Input


Formally outputs are discrete-time variable, and by default the value is 0.

At run time, when the activity starts, the output variable takes the value either from:

+ the constant value specified directly, if the king is Value
+ the value of the parameter, if the king is Parameter
+ the value of the input variable if the king is Input

At the next time of the simulation, what ever happens, the value of the variable
goes back to the d√©fault value.

## The configuration

The configuration managed by the GUI handles many items.

### The plan to be used by the model

The GUI provide a configuration where only the single edited plan file
is loaded.  By default the plan is loaded a single time.

### Ouput managment

Output ports of the model are managed automatically.
Parameters involved for the outputs also.
Input ports corresponding to input values also.
